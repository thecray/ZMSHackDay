		"Title": "CDC Trigger Implementation",
		"FunctionalNotes": "The RMS database has CDC enabled, which involves the addition of a new schema (14, cdc), a new filegroup, and a new file.  Consequences of the enabling of CDC are that two new jobs are added to SQL Server Agent per RMS database with CDC enabled (capture and cleanup), and a new user (cdc) is added to the database.  These jobs and the new user should be left untouched.\n\nWhere management of databases does not use the master spts provided by DT, or they are not kept up to date, consideration should be given as to what changes are necessary for CDC integrity to be retained.",
		"DeveloperNotes": "Implementation of CDC\nWhat is it?\nAt this point it is the putting in place of the components needed to implement cdc tracking on tables.  It does not itself add cdc tracking.\nIt can be considered the equivalent of adding the BI database without adding BI processing.\nIt is invisible to the client, it does nothing.  Except where the client looks after the databases themselves.\n\nWhat does the update do?\nIt enables CDC on the RMS database, creates a new filegroup, creates a new file, adds the filegroup to the file.\nSQL Server does some changes to support this:\nIt adds a new schema, cdc (schema_id = 14).  (We must limit our queries of system tables to the dbo schema (schema_id = 1), we never bothered because we never had cause.  This update includes some amendments to that effect.)\nIt adds a new user, cdc.\nIt adds two new scheduled jobs, capture and cleanup, in the cdc schema.  These are executed by the cdc user.  Removing the cdc user causes the cleanup job to error.  Don\u0027t do that.\n\nIt adds new spt stored procedures:\nspt_EnableCDCForAnRMSDatabase - the procedure that enables cdc on the RMS database, creates a new filegroup, creates a new file, adds the filegroup to the file\nspt_SetCDCTrackingForATable - sets (or unsets) CDC tracking for a table, runs spt_CreateCDCTrigger and spt_EnableOrDisableRMSBITriggersForATable\nspt_SetCDCTrackingForAllTablesWithABITrigger - runs spt_SetCDCTrackingForATable for all tables with a BI trigger\nspt_CreateCDCTrigger - takes the BI trigger on the RMS table as a template, makes changes to make it suitable for the BI table, and applies it to the BI table\nspt_EnableOrDisableRMSBITriggersForATable - enables or disables the RMS BI trigger(s) on a table\n\nIt updates the RMS spt procedures that change the schema.\nspt_AddColumnToTable\nspt_AlterColumnOnTable\nspt_RemoveColumnFromTable\nspt_Rename_Column\nWhen called, these do additional things where the RMS table has cdc tracking enabled.  It disables then enables tracking.\n\nIt updates the RMS spt procedure that deletes and reseeds a table\nspt_DeleteAndReseed\nA table that has cdc tracking enabled cannot have TRUNCATE TABLE run against it.  This test is added to the existing test for a FK reference. \n\nIt updates all existing BI triggers to include new standard code that exits the trigger, doing nothing, if the table has cdc tracking enabled (except when integration tests are being run).  Note that the intent is that the RMS BI trigger would also be disabled when cdc tracking is enabled.\n\n**Any overrides of standard Iho triggers, and any new client-specific BI triggers should have that standard code added, as soon as possible.**",

Instead, it runs behind a reverse proxy (such as Nginx, Apache, or IIS) that handles SSL/TLS termination. This setup is intended solely for local development.\n\nimage.png",
